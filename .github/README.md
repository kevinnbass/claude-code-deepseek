# Claude Code with Deepseek and Gemini Models ðŸ§ 

A proxy server that lets you use Claude Code with Deepseek and Google Gemini models, providing up to **96% cost savings** while maintaining high-quality code assistance.

## âœ¨ Special Feature: `/brainstorm` command

The `/brainstorm` command connects directly to **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** for exceptional creative problem-solving:

```
/brainstorm How can I optimize my React application's performance?
```

## How It Works

This proxy sits between Claude Code and alternative AI models:
- Uses Deepseek for Sonnet models (complex tasks, code generation)
- Uses Gemini for Haiku models (simple tasks, fast responses)
- Full support for all Claude Code features (tools, streaming, etc.)
- Provides the same familiar interface with massive cost savings
